1.1. The three main purposes of an operating system are:

- Resource Management
- Process Management
- User Interface

1.2. It's appropriate for an operating system to "waste" resources when ensuring security, reliability, or meeting real-time constraints. This isn't really wasteful as it prioritizes critical system needs.

1.3. The main difficulty in writing an operating system for a real-time environment is ensuring predictable and reliable timing constraints.

1.4. Arguments for including applications in the operating system:

- Convenience and integration
- Efficient resource usage

Arguments against:

- Security risks
- Bloat and complexity

1.5. The distinction between kernel mode and user mode provides a basic protection mechanism by limiting user access to sensitive resources and operations.

1.6. Privileged instructions:

- Set value of timer
- Clear memory
- Issue a trap instruction
- Turn off interrupts
- Modify entries in device-status table
- Switch from user to kernel mode
- Access I/O device

1.7. Difficulties with placing the operating system in an unmodifiable memory partition:

- Updates and maintenance become complicated
- Inflexibility in adapting to changing system requirements

1.8. Multiple modes of operation can be used for:

- Additional levels of protection or security
- Specialized processing or optimization

1.9. Timers can compute the current time by incrementing a counter at regular intervals and storing the value.

1.10. Caches are useful for:

- Malicious code or data tampering

Ensuring the same degree of security as a dedicated machine is challenging due to shared resources and multiple users.

1.13. Resources to be managed carefully in different settings:

- Mainframe/minicomputer systems: CPU, memory, storage
- Workstations connected to servers: network bandwidth, server resources
- Mobile computers: power consumption, memory, storage

1.14. A user would be better off using a time-sharing system than a PC or single-user workstation when:

- Multiple users need to access the same resources
- Resource utilization needs to be optimized

Asymmetric multiprocessor systems: processors have different roles, memory, and resources

Advantages of multiprocessor systems:

- Improved performance
- Increased throughput
- Fault tolerance

Disadvantage:

- Complexity in synchronization and communication

1.16. Clustered systems differ from multiprocessor systems in that they are multiple machines working together, rather than multiple processors on one machine. Cooperation between machines requires:

- Networking and communication protocols
- Shared storage and resources

1.17. Cluster software can manage access to data on disk through:

- Master-slave replication: one node is primary, others replicate data
- Peer-to-peer replication: all nodes equal, replicate data among themselves

Benefits and disadvantages depend on the specific implementation and requirements.

1.18. Network computers differ from traditional personal computers in that they rely on a network for resources and storage, rather than local hardware. Usage scenarios:

- Thin clients for remote access
- Cloud computing and virtualization

1.19. Interrupts: signals to the CPU to interrupt current execution and handle an event
Traps: intentional interrupts generated by a user program for specific purposes (e.g., system calls)

1.20. Direct memory access (DMA) coordinates with the CPU through:

- Interrupts and interrupts handlers
- Memory mapping and control registers

DMA transfer completion is signaled through interrupts or polling. Execution of other programs may be interrupted or slowed due to memory access and resource contention.

1.21. It is possible to construct a secure operating system for computers without privileged mode, using software-based protection mechanisms and careful design.

1.22. Caching systems are designed with multiple levels (local and shared) to:

- Reduce memory access latency
- Improve cache hit rates
- Increase overall performance

1.23. Data residing in memory can have different values in each local cache due to:

- Cache coherence issues
- Out-of-order execution
- Memory access patterns

1.24. The problem of maintaining coherence of cached data manifests itself in:

- Single-processor systems: cache coherence protocols
- Multiprocessor systems: cache coherence protocols and synchronization
- Distributed systems: data consistency and replication

2.9. Five services provided by an operating system, along with how they create convenience for users, are:

- Process management (conveniently manages multiple tasks)
- Memory management (automatically allocates and deallocates memory)
- File management (organizes and retrieves files)
- Security (protects against unauthorized access)
- Networking (enables communication between devices)

2.10. Some systems store the operating system in firmware for speed and reliability, while others store it on disk for flexibility and customizability.

2.11. A system can be designed to allow a choice of operating systems by using a bootstrap program that loads the selected operating system into memory.

2.12. The two categories of services and functions provided by an operating system are:

- Control programs (manage hardware and software resources)

======================== 3 =========================


3.1. The output at LINE A will be the process ID of the child process.

3.2. Including the initial parent process, a total of 8 processes are created by the program shown in Figure 3.31.

3.3. Concurrent processing adds the following complications to an operating system:

- Process synchronization and communication
- Deadlock handling
- Context switching and overhead

3.4. If the new context is already loaded into one of the register sets, a context switch occurs immediately. If the new context is in memory and all register sets are in use, the operating system must save the current context, load the new context from memory, and restore the new context's registers.

3.5. The stack is not shared between the parent and child processes. The heap and shared memory segments are shared.

3.6. The algorithm does not execute correctly if the ACK message is lost due to a network problem. The sequence of messages would be:

Client: Request → Server: Response → Client: ACK (lost)

The "exactly once" semantic is not preserved in this case.

3.7. To guarantee the "exactly once" semantic for RPCs in a distributed system susceptible to server failure, mechanisms such as:

- Idempotent operations
- Server-side logging and recovery
- Client-side retry and timeout

are required.

3.8. Short-term scheduling (also known as CPU scheduling) selects a process to run on the CPU for a short period. Medium-term scheduling (also known as swapping) selects which processes to keep in main memory and which to swap out to secondary storage. Long-term scheduling (also known as job scheduling) selects which jobs (processes) to admit to the system.

3.9. The kernel performs the following actions to context-switch between processes:

- Saves the current process's context (registers, PC, etc.)
- Loads the new process's context
- Restores the new process's registers and PC
- Resumes the new process

3.10. A process tree shows the parent-child relationships between processes. The ps -ael command can be used to obtain process information on UNIX or Linux systems.

3.11. The init process on UNIX and Linux systems is responsible for process termination, including:

- Reaping zombie processes
- Executing the exit handler
- Freeing resources

3.12. Including the initial parent process, a total of 8 processes are created by the program shown in Figure 3.32.

3.13. The line of code marked printf("LINE J") in Figure 3.33 will be reached if the fork() call fails.

3.14. The values of pid at lines A, B, C, and D are:

- A: 2603 (child process)
- B: 2603 (child process)
- C: 2600 (parent process)
- D: 2600 (parent process)

3.15. Ordinary pipes are more suitable for communication between related processes, while named pipes are more suitable for communication between unrelated processes.

3.16. Not enforcing either the "at most once" or "exactly once" semantic can lead to:

- Duplicate or lost messages
- Inconsistent state
- Security vulnerabilities

A mechanism with neither guarantee may be useful for best-effort communication or in systems with limited resources.

3.17. The output at lines X and Y will be:

- X: CHILD: 0 -4 -8 -12 -16
- Y: PARENT: 0 1 2 3 4

3.18. The benefits and disadvantages of each are:

- Synchronous and asynchronous communication:
    - Synchronous: blocking, easy to implement, less overhead
    - Synchronous: may cause deadlock, slower
    - Asynchronous: non-blocking, faster, more complex
- Automatic and explicit buffering:
    - Automatic: easier to use, less overhead
    - Automatic: may cause buffer overflow
    - Explicit: more control, slower
- Send by copy and send by reference:
    - Send by copy: safer, more overhead
    - Send by copy: slower
    - Send by reference: faster, less overhead
- Fixed-sized and variable-sized messages:
    - Fixed-sized: easier to implement, less overhead
    - Fixed-sized: may waste space
    - Variable-sized: more flexible, more complex

3.19. The C program can be written using the fork() system call to create a zombie process. The parent process must exit or wait for the child process to complete.

3.20. The API for obtaining and releasing a pid can be implemented using a bitmap to represent available pids. The functions are:

- int allocate_map(void)
- int allocate_pid(void)
- void release_pid(int pid)

3.21. The C program can be written using the fork() system call to generate the Collatz sequence in the child process.

3.22. The program can be designed using POSIX shared memory to establish a shared-memory object between the parent and child processes. The parent process will:

a. Establish the shared-memory object (shm_open(), ftruncate(), and mmap())
b. Create the child process and wait for it to terminate
c. Output the contents of shared memory
d. Remove the shared-memory object

The parent and child processes will be synchronized using the wait() system call.

3.23. The date server can be modified to deliver a quote of the day instead of the current date. The server will listen on port 6017 and respond with a quote containing fewer than 512 characters. The date client can be used to read the quotes returned by the server.

3.24. A haiku server can be written to listen on port 5575 and respond with a haiku when a client connects. The date client can be used to read the quotes returned by the haiku server.

3.25. An echo server can be written using the Java networking API to echo back whatever it receives from a client. The server will:

- Read data from the socket into a buffer
- Write the contents of the buffer back to the client

The server will break out of the loop when the client closes the connection.

3.26. A program can be designed using ordinary pipes to send a string message from one process to another, which will reverse the case of each character and send it back to the first process. This will require using two pipes.

3.27. A file-copying program named filecopy can be designed using ordinary pipes to copy a file from the file to be copied to the destination file. The program will:

- Create an ordinary pipe
- Write the contents of the file to be copied to the pipe
- Read the file from the pipe and write it to the destination file

Here are the answers to the questions:

4.1. Two programming examples where multithreading provides better performance than a single-threaded solution are:

- Web servers: handling multiple client requests concurrently
- Scientific simulations: performing calculations in parallel

4.2. Two differences between user-level threads and kernel-level threads are:

- User-level threads are managed by a thread library, while kernel-level threads are managed by the operating system
- User-level threads are faster and more efficient, while kernel-level threads provide more functionality and support

4.3. The actions taken by a kernel to context-switch between kernel-level threads are:

- Save the current thread's context
- Restore the new thread's context
- Switch to the new thread

4.4. The resources used when a thread is created are:

- Program counter
- Registers
- Stack
- Memory

These differ from process creation, which requires more resources such as:

- Memory space
- File descriptors
- I/O devices

4.5. It is not necessary to bind a real-time thread to an LWP, as LWPs are used to map user-level threads to kernel threads, and real-time threads can be scheduled directly by the kernel.

4.6. Two programming examples where multithreading does not provide better performance than a single-threaded solution are:

- Simple arithmetic operations
- Sequential file processing

4.7. A multithreaded solution using multiple kernel threads can provide better performance than a single-threaded solution on a single-processor system if:

- The threads perform I/O operations or wait for external events
- The threads perform parallel computations

4.8. The components of program state shared across threads in a multithreaded process are:

- Heap memory
- Global variables

4.9. A multithreaded solution using multiple user-level threads can achieve better performance on a multiprocessor system than on a single-processor system by:

- Distributing threads across processors
- Increasing parallelism

4.10. Opening each new website in a separate thread would not achieve the same benefits as opening each new website in a separate process, as threads share memory and resources, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.

4.11. Yes, it is possible to have concurrency but not parallelism, as concurrency refers to the ability of multiple tasks to overlap in time, while parallelism refers to the simultaneous execution of tasks.

4.12. Using Amdahl's Law, the speedup gain for an application with a 60% parallel component for two processing cores is 1.57, and for four processing cores is 2.28.

4.13. The problems exhibit:

- Task parallelism: multithreaded statistical program, multithreaded Sudoku validator
- Data parallelism: multithreaded sorting program, multithreaded web server

4.14. For the CPU-intensive application:

- Create one thread for input and output
- Create four threads for the CPU-intensive portion (one for each processor)

4.15.

a. Four unique processes are created
b. Two unique threads are created

4.16. Linux treats processes and threads similarly, using the clone() system call, while Windows treats them differently, using a notation where the process data structure contains pointers to separate threads.

4.17. The output at LINE C and LINE P would be:

CHILD: value = 5
PARENT: value = 0

4.18. The performance implications are:

a. Poor performance due to limited kernel threads
b. Good performance with equal kernel threads and processing cores
c. Good performance with more kernel threads than processing cores, but potential overhead due to thread management

4.19. Two operations suitable to perform between disabling and enabling thread cancellation are:

- Memory allocation and deallocation
- File operations

4.20. The multithreaded program would test the pid manager by creating 100 threads, each requesting a pid, sleeping for a random time, and then releasing the pid.

4.21. The multithreaded program would create three worker threads to calculate the average, minimum, and maximum values of the list of numbers, and the parent thread would output the results.

4.22. The multithreaded program would generate random points, count the points within the circle, and estimate π using the formula π = 4 × (number of points in circle) / (total number of points).

4.23. The program would use OpenMP to parallelize the generation of points, and calculate π only once outside the parallel region.

4.24. The multithreaded program would create a separate thread to output prime numbers less than or equal to the number entered by the user.

4.25. The socket-based date server would create a separate thread to service each client request.

4.26. The multithreaded program would generate the Fibonacci sequence in a separate thread, and the parent thread would output the sequence when the child thread finishes.

4.27. The modified echo server would create a new thread for each client connection, allowing it to handle multiple clients concurrently.
